  <h1>Link to the link of stuff</h1>
<p> Welp this is the place with all the stuff.. It contains a link to a place where I write more things and where it isn't as complicated to navigate through unlike this website that doens't even have a name.. and that is probably poorly implemented.. I don't know how people do this
