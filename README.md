# snake

This is a little project that I made to implement snake using javascript.
It was based off a medium article, but I added some buttons to improve the user interface.

Controls:
Use your keyboards arrow keys or click the UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT button to move the snake.
Press the Start button to initialize the game.
Restart the page to restart the game.
